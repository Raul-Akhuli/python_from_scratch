# Variables and identifiers are not the same; an identifier is a name used 
# to uniquely identify an entity in a program, while a variable is a specific 
# type of identifier that refers to a memory location storing a value.
# All variables are identifiers, but not all identifiers are variables

# Identifier	A name assigned to an entity in a program, such as a variable, function, or class.
# Variable	    A specific type of identifier that refers to a memory location used to store a value.
